## Instances
Instances contained in folder data. 

## Algorithm
The Folder `src` includes the code scripts used in the paper. 

## Requirements

We use the a few standard Python packages, which should be clear at the beginning of each Python file. It is worth noting that we use 
1. Gurobi v11 as the solver.
2. iGraph and Networkx for handling graphs.


## Results
We report the figures of our paper in the Folder `results`
